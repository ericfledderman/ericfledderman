## Intro
Hi, I’m Eric. You must be wondering how I got here...

## Past
It started with dial-up, a stack of “DEV for Dummies” books, and a dangerous level of curiosity.  I’ve been releasing features since before AIM had away messages.

## Present
Now I help small businesses move fast, work smart, and cut through the bullshit.  Tech doesn’t have to be complicated—it just has to work.

## Future
Let’s build cool shit.
